---

## ü§ñ Phase 3: Agentic AI Integration

This is where AMBAG becomes truly intelligent and autonomous.

### 3.1 Comprehensive AI Analysis with Autonomous Execution
The AI analyzes your goal and automatically executes actions.

**Endpoint:** `POST /ai-tools/comprehensive-analysis`

```json
{
  "group_id": "goal_456",
  "analysis_types": ["progress_tracking", "risk_assessment", "optimization", "predictions"],
  "auto_execute": true
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "analysis_id": "analysis_goal_456_20250730_140000",
  "group_id": "goal_456",
  "analysis": {
    "progress_tracking": {
      "current_progress": 60.0,
      "milestone_status": "on_track",
      "completion_trend": "positive"
    },
    "risk_assessment": {
      "deadline_risk": "medium",
      "member_participation": "good",
      "payment_velocity": "acceptable"
    },
    "recommended_actions": [
      {
        "action_type": "send_reminder",
        "target_members": ["mike_reyes", "sarah_garcia"],
        "action_data": {
          "amount_due": 1000.0,
          "deadline": "2025-12-31",
          "urgency": "medium"
        }
      }
    ]
  },
  "autonomous_actions_triggered": ["send_reminder"],
  "auto_execute": true,
  "timestamp": "2025-07-30T14:00:00"
}
```

**üéØ What Happens Automatically:**
- AI analyzes goal progress, risks, and patterns

- **Automatically sends personalized reminders** to late contributors
- **Escalates to manager** if deadline approaches with low progress
- **Triggers fund transfer alerts** when goal is completed
- All actions execute in the background without human intervention

### 3.2 Smart AI-Powered Reminders
